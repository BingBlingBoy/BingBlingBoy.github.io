          Over the last 100 years, computer science has made tremendous contributions to society that have benefited the lives of millions making our lives 
          easier to live in.
          To cracking the uncrackable engima machine that was one of the main contributions to ending world war 2 to the launch to the moon.
          Here are some of the things we are going to talk about on this document:

          Improvements to healthcare
        </h2>
    
        <p>
          Health Informatics is a new field developed by the combination of the health industry and the power of computer science. 
          Its purpose is to utilise computer logic into diagnose diseases in a patient and be able to treat them with doctors supervision. </br> 
          It also provides better hospital management and coordination within a hospital making reports digital and intuitive compared to data on paper files.
          For example, have been used to track global disease outbreaks like the <cite><a href="https://crhscountyline.com/features/2021/10/26/computer-science-in-health/#:~:text=In%20this%20subfield%2C%20computer%20technologies,study%20and%20program%20these%20interfaces.computers">Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 map</a></cite>.</br> 
          Its job is to collect the data of coronavirus updates with geographic data to produce a live map of the world informing people of the rising cases in different countries. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The field of Nanomedicine utilises nanotechnology to help treat a patient for example <cite><a href="https://www.britishsocietynanomedicine.org/what-is-nanomedicine/">nanomedicines</a></cite> are used to <blockquote>"increase the behaviour of drug substances”.</blockquote> 
          They all so facilitate an ease of delivery to the area of disease within the human body so that the drug can treat it for long periods. 
          According to the <cite><a href="https://www.britishsocietynanomedicine.org/what-is-nanomedicine/">British Society of Nanomedicine</a></cite> some drugs have little solubility to water, so the human body won’t sufficiently absorb the drug to treat the problem.

          Expanding Communication
        </h2>

        <p>
          With advancements of computer science and technology, it allows us to communicate our thoughts and ideas globally as well as becoming an integral part to our lives. 
          We can communicate with anyone at any time, allowing us to talk to our families and friends who we haven’t spoken to or seenfor a while.
          The creation of forums and social media allow young computer scientists to survive their degree as well as discuss and develop important topics and ideas. 
          This allows access to different perspectives to a problem to allow creative solutions and innovation. 
          It has also allowed people to critisize current issues in the world and let their voices be heard.

          Predictions
        </h2>

        <p>
          Computing has allowed us to collect data on just about anything to the point where we can start noticing patterns within that data.
          Various data collecting and representing techniques have been utilise to detect patterns in weather or even natural disasters to 
          produce a prediction on what may happen in the future. It may not be perfect, however it gives a good indication on what to expect on that day.
          This can help prepare for worst case scenarios like a flash floods where it can save human lives and minimise economic damage.
